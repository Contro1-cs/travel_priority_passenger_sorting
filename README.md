# travel_priority_passenger_sorting
This is just a beta code that I am working on which allows passenger to choose what catagory of co-passenger he wants to travel with. The code is written keeping in mind the arrangement of standard Indian railway seats. For now it only intakes 2 passenger inputs. Working on larger number of inputs and sorting by keeping 6 passengers in one section.
